# Zomato-Restuarent-Review-Webapp-Flask-Machine-Learning-
Worked with big zomato dataset .Have done EDA and visualization .Then I worked with different ml models to find the best prediction . Surprisingly I got almost 94% accuracy.Then I build the model(.py) in pycharm with the edited datasset which I simplify . Then I integrate Flask in it and build a awesome webapp . Hope u'll like it .
